Guess My Number
A simple number guessing game created by Owais Ahmad for the study of Jonas Schmedtmann's lecture.

The game generates a random number between 1 and 20, and the player tries to guess the number. The player can enter their guess in the text field and click the "Guess" button. If the guess is correct, the player wins the game. If the guess is incorrect, the player is given a hint about whether the number is higher or lower than their guess. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
